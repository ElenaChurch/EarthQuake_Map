# EarthQuake Map
This is a map of earth quakes across the world that have happened in a week. The information was pulled from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/. Then using JavaScript and leaflet a map was created with colored markers to indicate earthquakes that have happened in the past week. The color of each of the markers corresponds with the depth of the earth quake and the size of the circle marker indicates the magnitude of the earth quake. A very simple web page was made to display the leaflet map.
